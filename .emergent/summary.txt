<analysis>**original_problem_statement:**
The user wants to build a comprehensive project management application named XON Architect. The initial phase involved setting up role-based access and core features like inventory management, RAB (cost estimation) lifecycle, and project phasing.

The development has since moved to a series of rapid feature enhancements and bug fixes based on user feedback, including:
- Separating Planning Projects () from Execution Projects () into distinct database collections and sidebar menus.
- Creating a detailed project view page accessible from the project lists.
- Adding a chat/discussion feature with @mentions on the project detail page.
- Simplifying the admin sidebar for better user experience.
- Adding Shop Drawing and 3D Modeling sections to the Planning Team's dashboard.
- Implementing workflow automation, such as auto-filling data when creating an RAB from a planning project.
- Fixing various bugs related to data fetching, saving, and UI consistency across different user roles.
- The latest request is to implement multi-select checkboxes on both the planning and execution project lists to allow for bulk actions like deleting or editing multiple projects at once.

**User's preferred language**: The user's primary language is **Indonesian**. The next agent MUST respond in Indonesian.

**what currently exists?**
The application is a full-stack web app with a React frontend and a FastAPI backend. A major architectural change was recently implemented to separate projects into two distinct collections in MongoDB:  for projects in the planning phase and  for projects in the execution phase. The UI has been updated with two separate sidebar menus for Admins (Daftar Proyek Perencanaan and Daftar Proyek Pelaksanaan). A new project detail page with a comment/mention system has also been added. The admin sidebar has been simplified to five key items.

**Last working item**:
-   **Last item agent was working**: Implementing a multi-select feature with checkboxes on the Daftar Proyek Perencanaan page () to enable bulk actions (edit, delete).
-   **Status**: IN PROGRESS
-   **Agent Testing Done**: N
-   **Which testing method agent to use?**: Frontend testing agent to verify the multi-select UI (checkboxes, bulk action buttons) and functionality on both project list pages ( and ).
-   **User Testing Done**: N

**All Pending/In progress Issue list**:
-   **Issue 1 (P0)**: Inefficient bulk actions implementation. The current logic for bulk delete calls the single-item delete endpoint in a loop. This is inefficient and not atomic. A placeholder function exists for bulk editing.
    -   **Attempted fixes**: The agent created frontend handler functions (, ) in .
    -   **Next debug checklist**:
        1.  Create dedicated backend endpoints (e.g.,  and ) that accept an array of project IDs.
        2.  These endpoints should use efficient MongoDB operations like  with the  operator.
        3.  Update the frontend handler functions to call these new bulk endpoints.
        4.  Implement the UI for bulk editing (e.g., a dialog to change status).
    -   **Why fix this issue and what will be achieved with the fix?**: To complete the user-requested feature for bulk actions and to make the operations more performant and reliable.
    -   **Status**: NOT STARTED
    -   **Is recurring issue?**: N
    -   **Should Test frontend/backend/both after fix?**: Both
    -   **Blocked on other issue**: None.

**In progress Task List**:
-   **Task 1 (P0)**: Complete the multi-select & bulk actions feature for both project lists.
    -   **Where to resume**:
        1.  Finalize the UI for bulk actions on . The state and handlers have been added, but the UI for bulk action buttons and the select all checkbox needs to be fully integrated and verified.
        2.  Replicate the entire multi-select and bulk action functionality on the Daftar Proyek Pelaksanaan page ().
        3.  Address Pending Issue 1 by implementing proper backend endpoints for bulk operations.
    -   **What will be achieved with this?**: Admins will be able to select multiple projects from either list and perform bulk updates or deletions, significantly improving efficiency.
    -   **Status**: IN PROGRESS
    -   **Should Test frontend/backend/both after fix?**: Both
    -   **Blocked on something**: None.

**Upcoming and Future Tasks**
-   **Upcoming Tasks**:
    -   **(P1) Add Graphs to Project Detail Page**: The user requested grafik on the project detail page (). This involves fetching financial/progress data and displaying it using a charting library.
-   **Future Tasks**: None explicitly mentioned beyond the current scope.

**Completed work in this session**
- **Recently completed**:
  -   Database and UI separation of Planning Projects and Execution Projects. (DONE)
  -   Data migration of existing planning projects to the new collection. (DONE)
  -   Creation of a Project Detail page with a chat/mention system. (DONE)
  -   Simplification of the Admin sidebar menu. (DONE)
  -   Addition of Modeling 3D and Shop Drawing modules to the Planning Dashboard. (DONE)
  -   Bugfix: Corrected material autocomplete in Tambah Transaksi to filter by project type, not project ID. (DONE)
  -   Bugfix: Resolved an issue preventing items from being added to an RAB. (DONE)
  -   Bugfix: Ensured new projects appear on lists immediately after creation. (DONE)
  -   Bugfix: Removed a redundant project list from the Drafter dashboard. (DONE)
  -   UI/UX Improvement: Refined the Create RAB flow to auto-fill data from the planning dashboard. (DONE)
  -   UI/UX Improvement: Renamed and clarified buttons and titles on the Planning Dashboard. (DONE)

**Known issue recurrence from previous fork**
-   None.

**Code Architecture**


**Key Technical Concepts**
-   **Frameworks**: FastAPI (Python), React (JavaScript).
-   **Database**: MongoDB. The architecture now uses separate collections (, ) to logically partition data. UUIDs are used for IDs.
-   **Backend**: Pydantic for validation, JWT for auth, role-based access control. New models include  and . New endpoints for bulk operations and data migration have been added.
-   **Frontend**: , , Shadcn/UI, Tailwind CSS. Implemented multi-select state management for bulk actions.

**key DB schema**
-   **planning_projects**: 
-   **projects**: 
-   **project_comments**: 

**changes in tech stack**
-   None.

**All files**
-   : Major changes to introduce new models (, , ), new collections, and corresponding endpoints for CRUD, bulk actions, and data migration.
-   : New file to list planning projects. Currently being modified to add multi-select and bulk actions.
-   : New file to show project details and the new chat feature.
-   : This page now lists execution projects. It needs to be updated with the same bulk-action features as .
-   : Modified to simplify the admin sidebar and add new menu items for the separated project lists.
-   : Updated with routes for the new  and  pages.

**Areas that need refactoring**:
- The bulk action handlers (, ) should be implemented with proper backend support instead of looping or being placeholders.

**key api endpoints**
-   : Fetches all planning-phase projects.
-   : Creates a new planning-phase project.
-   : Fetches all execution-phase projects.
-   : (One-time) Migrates old planning projects to the new collection.
-   : Fetches comments for a project.
-   : Adds a new comment to a project.
-   : Fetches a list of users for the @mention feature.

**Critical Info for New Agent**
- The core logic for projects has been split. Planning Projects are now managed via the  endpoint and stored in the  collection. Execution Projects use the existing  endpoint and  collection. Ensure you use the correct endpoints and pages for each phase.
- The immediate task is to finish the multi-select/bulk-action feature. This needs to be done for BOTH the  page and the  page, along with implementing efficient backend endpoints to support it.

**documents created in this job**
-   None.
