# START - Testing Protocol - DO NOT EDIT OR REMOVE THIS SECTION
#====================================================================================================

# THIS SECTION CONTAINS CRITICAL TESTING INSTRUCTIONS FOR BOTH AGENTS
# BOTH MAIN_AGENT AND TESTING_AGENT MUST PRESERVE THIS ENTIRE BLOCK

# Communication Protocol:
# If the `testing_agent` is available, main agent should delegate all testing tasks to it.
#
# You have access to a file called `test_result.md`. This file contains the complete testing state
# and history, and is the primary means of communication between main and the testing agent.
#
# Main and testing agents must follow this exact format to maintain testing data. 
# The testing data must be entered in yaml format Below is the data structure:
# 
## user_problem_statement: {problem_statement}
## backend:
##   - task: "Task name"
##     implemented: true
##     working: true  # or false or "NA"
##     file: "file_path.py"
##     stuck_count: 0
##     priority: "high"  # or "medium" or "low"
##     needs_retesting: false
##     status_history:

##
## agent_communication:
##     -agent: "main"  # or "testing" or "user"
##     -message: "Communication message between agents"

# Protocol Guidelines for Main agent
#
# 1. Update Test Result File Before Testing:
#    - Main agent must always update the `test_result.md` file before calling the testing agent
#    - Add implementation details to the status_history
#    - Set `needs_retesting` to true for tasks that need testing
#    - Update the `test_plan` section to guide testing priorities
#    - Add a message to `agent_communication` explaining what you've done
#
# 2. Incorporate User Feedback:
#    - When a user provides feedback that something is or isn't working, add this information to the relevant task's status_history
#    - Update the working status based on user feedback
#    - If a user reports an issue with a task that was marked as working, increment the stuck_count
#    - Whenever user reports issue in the app, if we have testing agent and task_result.md file so find the appropriate task for that and append in status_history of that task to contain the user concern and problem as well 
#
# 3. Track Stuck Tasks:
#    - Monitor which tasks have high stuck_count values or where you are fixing same issue again and again, analyze that when you read task_result.md
#    - For persistent issues, use websearch tool to find solutions
#    - Pay special attention to tasks in the stuck_tasks list
#    - When you fix an issue with a stuck task, don't reset the stuck_count until the testing agent confirms it's working
#
# 4. Provide Context to Testing Agent:
#    - When calling the testing agent, provide clear instructions about:
#      - Which tasks need testing (reference the test_plan)
#      - Any authentication details or configuration needed
#      - Specific test scenarios to focus on
#      - Any known issues or edge cases to verify
#
# 5. Call the testing agent with specific instructions referring to test_result.md
#
# IMPORTANT: Main agent must ALWAYS update test_result.md BEFORE calling the testing agent, as it relies on this file to understand what to test next.

user_problem_statement: |
  User meminta implementasi dua fitur baru:
  1. Fitur "Buat Project Baru" di Dashboard Planning Team:
     - Menambahkan button "Buat Project Baru" dengan icon Plus
     - Dialog form untuk input: Nama Proyek, Tipe Proyek (Interior/Arsitektur), Lokasi, Nilai Proyek, Deskripsi
     - Form submission ke endpoint POST /api/projects
     - Project yang dibuat akan otomatis dalam fase "perencanaan"
  
  2. Bug Fix: Error "Gagal menambahkan task" di Drafter Dashboard:
     - TaskInput model tidak sesuai dengan data yang dikirim frontend
     - Perlu update TaskInput model untuk support: duration_days, role, priority, status
     - Membuat project_id dan assigned_to menjadi optional

    message: |
      Implementasi fitur "Buat Project Baru" dan Bug Fix "Create Task" selesai:
      
      BACKEND (server.py):
      1. ✅ Verified endpoint POST /api/projects exists and supports Planning Team:
         - Endpoint automatically detects user role (project_planning_team)
         - Creates project with phase="perencanaan" for Planning Team
         - Creates project with phase="pelaksanaan" for other roles
         - Accepts ProjectInput: name, type, description, location, project_value
      
      2. ✅ Fixed TaskInput model to support Drafter Dashboard:
         - Added fields: duration_days, role, priority, status
         - Made project_id and assigned_to optional (not all tasks need assignment)
         - Updated defaults: priority="medium", status="pending"
      
      3. ✅ Simplified create_task function:
         - Removed hasattr() checks since TaskInput is now complete
         - Proper calculation of due_date from duration_days
         - Correct handling of optional fields
      
      FRONTEND (pages/planning/Dashboard.js):
      1. ✅ Added "Buat Project Baru" button with Plus icon
      2. ✅ Created dialog with complete form:
         - Nama Proyek (text input, required)
         - Tipe Proyek (select: Interior/Arsitektur, required)
         - Lokasi (text input, required)
         - Nilai Proyek (number input, required)
         - Deskripsi (textarea, optional)
      3. ✅ Form submission connected to POST /api/projects
      4. ✅ State management for dialog open/close
      5. ✅ Form reset after successful submission
      6. ✅ Toast notifications for success/error
      7. ✅ Reload overview after project creation
      
      FRONTEND (App.js):
      1. ✅ Added route /planning/dashboard
      2. ✅ Role protection for project_planning_team and admin
      3. ✅ Fixed blank page issue when navigating to /planning/dashboard
      
      Testing diperlukan:
      1. Backend: Test POST /api/projects endpoint (verify phase="perencanaan" for Planning Team)
      2. Backend: Test POST /api/tasks with Drafter data (title, description, priority, duration_days, role, status)
      3. Frontend: Test "Buat Project Baru" dialog and form submission
      4. Frontend: Test Drafter Dashboard create task functionality
      5. E2E: Planning Team creates project → Verify project appears in overview with correct phase
      6. E2E: Drafter creates task → Verify task appears with auto-calculated deadline
      
      Test credentials:
      - Admin: email="admin", password="admin" (has access to all roles including project_planning_team)
         - Bahan: Tersedia, Order (Pengambilan), Habis
         - Alat: Tersedia, Bagus, Rusak, Perlu di Retur, Dipinjam
      3. ✅ Updated status color mapping untuk semua status baru
      
      Testing diperlukan:
      1. Backend: Test transaksi dengan status 'receiving' → verify stok bertambah
      2. Backend: Test transaksi dengan status 'out_warehouse' → verify stok berkurang

      3. ✅ GET /api/projects returns 2 projects (both phase=pelaksanaan)
      4. ✅ GET /api/projects?phase=perencanaan returns empty array (no perencanaan projects)
      5. ✅ Project creation by admin user correctly sets phase='perencanaan'
      6. ✅ New project immediately appears in planning overview after creation
      7. ✅ All API endpoints working correctly
      
      📊 DEBUG TEST RESULTS:
      - Total Tests: 1/1 PASSED (100% success rate)
      - Admin authentication working ✓
      - Planning overview endpoint working correctly ✓
      - Project creation with correct phase working ✓
      - Project filtering by phase working ✓
      - New projects appear immediately in dashboard ✓
      
      🎯 CONCLUSION: NO BUG EXISTS - SYSTEM WORKING AS DESIGNED
